          <p>
            The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Dream Club is
            specialize in making life easy for ACLC Northbay ICT students. This
            group is made up of the greatest ICT students, and its goal is to
            teach other students about ICT issues most simply and
            straightforwardly possible. Self-study, especially when learning
            about technology, can be tough. If you want to be a computer
            scientist or an information technology engineer, you know how tough
            it is to study everything on your own. This is why this club was
            formed: to simplify and explain everything about ICT. The club is
            dedicated to provide the finest service possible for the school and
            acknowledge the importance of receiving feedback to create the
            greatest experience possible for our student members.

          <h2>History of the club</h2>
          <p>
            The ICT Dream Club was established under the order of the school in
            October of 2019 to help students improve their ICT skills. The club
            is under the supervision of Mr. Jackson Salas. The current number of
            officers for the academic year 2020-2021 is more than the number of
            officers from when it was created. The first activity of the club is
            the E- Tech Competition in which all grade 11 sections compete with
            each other‘s web pages on a specifically given subject and the
            competition will serve as their final grade for the Empowerment
            Technologies subject for the first semester. A Mr. & Ms. ICT Dream
            Club pageant is another competition to join for the ICT students of
            the school and a Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Tournament to help reduce
            the students’ academic stress. In 2022, the ICT Dream Club has
            launched its first ever ICT Peer Mentoring and Podcast. The theme of
            the podcast is about love and at the same time, blended with
            technology. The clubs continuously serve its member as its best.
